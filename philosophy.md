# Philosophy

Better communities begin with the software that powers them.

Waterhole doesn't try to reimagine what online communities are supposed to be. Rather, it puts the focus back on the things that matter. Healthy discussion. Sustainable ownership. Fulfilling the needs of independent communities and their members, rather than advertisers and shareholders.

## Inclusive Design

**Waterhole communities should be inclusive and accessible to everyone.**

Waterhole embodies this approach in its [Design System](./design/overview.md) â€“ a sane starting point, optimized for usability and human-friendliness. Waterhole strives to be [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) compliant and provide a good experience to users of screen readers and alternative input modalities.

## Flexibility

**Waterhole gives you the power to create exactly the community you need.**

Every community is different. Waterhole doesn't try and shy away from this fact with a one-size-fits-all approach. It embraces the challenges of integration and unique community requirements. Core features are thoughtfully implemented to serve multiple use cases. The concept of extensibility is pervasive throughout the codebase, allowing communities to implement custom functionality without accumulating technical debt.

Sane defaults

## Simple Tech

**Waterhole relies on a simple, resilient, proven technology stack.**

Waterhole combines the simplicity of a [Laravel](https://laravel.com) Multi-Page Application (MPA) architecture with the improved user experience of Single-Page Applications (SPA) via [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev). This makes for fast page loads, even in unfavorable network conditions. And it significantly reduces codebase complexity, leading to a more productive and enjoyable development experience for anyone working with Waterhole.

By adhering closely to Laravel conventions, there is less for new developers to learn

## Great Documentation

Waterhole is all about customization via code, so great documentation is imperative.

## Sustainably Independent

**Waterhole empowers communities to stand on their own two feet.**

The fate of your community shouldn't be tied to the whims of a large corporation or the fortune of an unprofitable SaaS company. Waterhole lets communities remain fully in control of their data by self-hosting it on a server of their choice. You pay once and own Waterhole forever.
