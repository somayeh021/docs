# Migrating from Other Platforms

If you have an existing community running on another platform, you may be able to migrate it to Waterhole.

Currently Waterhole provides experimental support for migrating data from [Flarum](https://flarum.org). Support for other platforms is planned – please [get in touch](https://waterhole.dev/support) if you would like to work with us to develop migration support for another platform.

## Migration Steps

### 1. Start With a Fresh Installation

You can only import data from another platform into a **fresh Waterhole installation, before the `waterhole:install` command has been run**. The Waterhole database must be completely empty to prevent any primary key conflicts with imported data.

Follow the [installation](./installation.md) process, but instead of running the `waterhole:install` command, run the database migrations directly:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This will set up the database without seeding any data or user accounts.

### 2. Install the Import Package

Run the following command to install the Waterhole Import package:

```bash
composer require waterhole/import
```

This package contains commands which we will use to import data from the legacy platform.

### 3. Add a Database Connection

Open up `config/database.php` and add a new database connection for your legacy platform's database. The easiest way to do this is to copy and paste one of the existing blocks in the `connections` array (usually the `mysql` one), and change its name and details. For example:

```php
'connections' => [
    // ...

    'flarum' => [
        'driver' => 'mysql',
        'host' => '127.0.0.1',
        'port' => '3306',
        'database' => 'flarum',
        'username' => 'flarum',
        'password' => 'password',
        'unix_socket' => '',
        'charset' => 'utf8mb4',
        'collation' => 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci',
        'prefix' => '',
        'prefix_indexes' => true,
        'strict' => true,
        'engine' => null,
        'options' => extension_loaded('pdo_mysql') ? array_filter([
            PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA => env('MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA'),
        ]) : [],
    ],
]
```

### 4. Run the Import Command

Run the appropriate `waterhole:import:*` command to import data from the legacy platform. You will be asked which database connection to import data from – select the connection that you configured in the previous step. The import will be attempted and any progress and errors will be displayed.

## Supported Platforms
