# Alerts
Alerts provide contextual feedback to the user.

Alerts may include an icon and action buttons. They can be shown inline or as a toast.

## CSS
The `.alert` class is combined with a `.bg` color class to create the alert container. `.alert__icon`, `.alert__message`, and `.alert__actions` lay out the contents of the alert.

```blade render
<div class="alert bg-success">
  <span class="alert__icon">
      <x-waterhole::icon icon="tabler-check"/>
  </span>
  <p>Action successful.</p>
  <span class="alert__actions">
    <button class="btn">Done</button>
  </span>
</div>
```

## Blade Component
Use the [`<x-waterhole::alert>` component](https://waterhole.dev/docs/references/Waterhole/View/Components/Alert.php) to render an alert in a Blade template. Pass a `type`, which corresponds to the name of one of the `.bg` color classes. An icon will be selected automatically:

```blade render
<div class="stack gap-sm">
    <x-waterhole::alert type="success">The action was successful.</x-waterhole::alert>
    <x-waterhole::alert type="success-soft">The action was successful.</x-waterhole::alert>
    <x-waterhole::alert type="warning">Something needs your attention.</x-waterhole::alert>
    <x-waterhole::alert type="warning-soft">Something needs your attention.</x-waterhole::alert>
    <x-waterhole::alert type="danger">There was an error.</x-waterhole::alert>
    <x-waterhole::alert type="danger-soft">There was an error.</x-waterhole::alert>
</div>
```

### Icon
You can pass the name of an `icon` to use instead of the default:

```blade render
<x-waterhole::alert type="danger" icon="tabler-circle-minus">
  Access denied.
</x-waterhole::alert>
```

### Actions
Alerts can be made dismissible by adding the `dismissible` property:

```blade render
<x-waterhole::alert type="danger" dismissible>
  Make me go away, I dare you.
</x-waterhole::alert>
```

You can also render a custom action in the `action` slot:

```blade render
<x-waterhole::alert type="warning" dismissible>
  Log in is required for this section.
  <x-slot:action>
    <a href="#" class="btn">Log In</a>
  </x-slot>
</x-waterhole::alert>
```

## Toasts
Waterhole uses an [inclusive Alerts element](https://github.com/tobyzerner/inclusive-elements/tree/master/src/alerts) to manage accessible toast messages displayed at the top of the page. If you need to interact directly with this element, you can obtain a reference to it via `window.Waterhole.alerts`.

You can show simple toast messages (`success`, `warning`, and `danger` messages) by setting Laravel session `flash` data:

```php
session()->flash('success', 'Task was successful!');
session()->flash('warning', 'Something needs your attention.');
session()->flash('danger', 'There was an error.');
```
