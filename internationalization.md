# Internationalization
Waterhole features a powerful localization system using [Project Fluent](https://projectfluent.org) on top of the Laravel Translator.

If you're developing an [extension](./distribution.md), or if your forum is multi-lingual, you should take advantage of Waterhole's internationalization capabilities.

Fluent is a fully-featured localization system for natural-sounding translations. Read the [Fluent Syntax Guide](https://projectfluent.org/fluent/guide/) to learn more about syntax and its benefits.

Waterhole uses the [`laravel-fluent` package](https://github.com/jrmajor/laravel-fluent) to replace the default Laravel translator with one that supports loading translations from `.ftl` files.

## Defining Translations
Translations are stored in files within the `resources/lang` directory. Within this directory, create a subdirectory for each language you want to support. You can add translations in both `.php` files in the Laravel [short key format](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/localization#using-short-keys), and in Fluent `.ftl` files, with the latter taking precedence.

```
/resources
  /lang
    /en
      stream.ftl
      messages.php
    /fr
      stream.ftl
      messages.php
```

If you're developing an extension, you'll need to register your translation files with a namespace in the boot method of a service provider:

```php
$this->loadTranslationsFrom(__DIR__.'/../resources/lang', 'acme-example');
```

## Retrieving Translations
You may retrieve translation strings from your language files using the `__` helper function:

```php
__('stream.shared-photos', [
    'userName' => 'Toby',
    'photoCount' => 2,
    'userGender' => 'male',
]); // Toby added 2 new photos to his stream.
```

Extensions must use their registered namespace prefix:

```php
echo __('acme-example::messages.hello');
```

There is no need to use the `trans_choice` helper as the Fluent format eliminates the need for another function.
